abstract = {As materials data sets grow in size and scope, the role of data mining and statistical learning methods to analyze these materials data sets and build predictive models is becoming more important. This manuscript introduces matminer, an open-source, Python-based software platform to facilitate data-driven methods of analyzing and predicting materials properties. Matminer provides modules for retrieving large data sets from external databases such as the Materials Project, Citrination, Materials Data Facility, and Materials Platform for Data Science. It also provides implementations for an extensive library of feature extraction routines developed by the materials community, with 47 featurization classes that can generate thousands of individual descriptors and combine them into mathematical functions. Finally, matminer provides a visualization module for producing interactive, shareable plots. These functions are designed in a way that integrates closely with machine learning and data analysis packages already developed and in use by the Python data science community. We explain the structure and logic of matminer, provide a description of its various modules, and showcase several examples of how matminer can be used to collect data, reproduce data mining studies reported in the literature, and test new methodologies.}

abstract = {We present the Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) library, a robust, open-source Python library for materials analysis. A key enabler in high-throughput computational materials science efforts is a robust set of software tools to perform initial setup for the calculations (e.g., generation of structures and necessary input files) and post-calculation analysis to derive useful material properties from raw calculated data. The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Projectâ€™s REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgenâ€™s interface to the Materials Projectâ€™s RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Liâ€“Snâ€“S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.}

	abstract = {Thermoelectric materials can be potentially applied to waste heat recovery and solid-state cooling because they allow a direct energy conversion between heat and electricity and vice versa. The accelerated materials design based on machine learning has enabled the systematic discovery of promising materials. Herein we proposed a successful strategy to discover and design a series of promising half-Heusler thermoelectric materials through the iterative combination of unsupervised machine learning with the labeled known half-Heusler thermoelectric materials. Subsequently, optimized zT values of \~{}0.5 at 925 K for p-type Sc0.7Y0.3NiSb0.97Sn0.03 and \~{}0.3 at 778 K for n-type Sc0.65Y0.3Ti0.05NiSb were experimentally achieved on the same parent ScNiSb.},

@article{NaGyoungS2021,
	abstract = {Dopants play an important role in synthesizing materials to improve target materials properties or stabilize the materials. In particular, the dopants are essential to improve thermoelectic performances of the materials. However, existing machine learning methods cannot accurately predict the materials properties of doped materials due to severely nonlinear relations with their materials properties. Here, we propose a unified architecture of neural networks, called DopNet, to accurately predict the materials properties of the doped materials. DopNet identifies the effects of the dopants by explicitly and independently embedding the host materials and the dopants. In our evaluations, DopNet outperformed existing machine learning methods in predicting experimentally measured thermoelectric properties, and the error of DopNet in predicting a figure of merit (ZT) was 0.06 in mean absolute error. In particular, DopNet was significantly effective in an extrapolation problem that predicts ZTs of unknown materials, which is a key task to discover novel thermoelectric materials.},

@article{ShengYe2020,
	abstract = {The Materials Genome Initiative requires the crossing of material calculations, machine learning, and experiments to accelerate the material development process. In recent years, data-based methods have been applied to the thermoelectric field, mostly on the transport properties. In this work, we combined data-driven machine learning and first-principles automated calculations into an active learning loop, in order to predict the p-type power factors (PFs) of diamond-like pnictides and chalcogenides. Our active learning loop contains two procedures (1) based on a high-throughput theoretical database, machine learning methods are employed to select potential candidates and (2) computational verification is applied to these candidates about their transport properties. The verification data will be added into the database to improve the extrapolation abilities of the machine learning models. Different strategies of selecting candidates have been tested, finally the Gradient Boosting Regression model of Query by Committee strategy has the highest extrapolation accuracy (the Pearson R = 0.95 on untrained systems). Based on the prediction from the machine learning models, binary pnictides, vacancy, and small atom-containing chalcogenides are predicted to have large PFs. The bonding analysis reveals that the alterations of anionic bonding networks due to small atoms are beneficial to the PFs in these compounds.},

abstract = {In this work, various machine learning (ML) techniques were employed to accelerate the designing of aluminum (Al) alloys with improved performance based on the age hardening concept. For this purpose, data of Al-Cu-Mg-x (x: Zn, Zr, etc.) alloys, including composition, aging condition (time and temperature), important physical and chemical properties, and hardness were collected from the literature to train the ML algorithms for predicting Al alloys with superior hardness. The results showed that the model obtained by the gradient boosted tree (GBT) could efficiently predict the hardness of unexplored alloys.}
